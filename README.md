Example website demo that shows how to use NextJS with Prismic. 

This sample is introducing [Integration Fields](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/1401146-introduction-to-integration-fields) a Prismic feature, here is the [JSON file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Gholgot/650aebf9ae883b551b2dc102c2d6620c/raw/b2e2aa8bb0a60104d6ea6bae469a3b3447278cf7/coffee_list.json) we use to simulate an API 

Prismic allows you to feature products in your website & campaign pages by connecting Prismic to your existing catalog or custom API
